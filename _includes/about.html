                <p style="font-size: 20px" class="left-three"> I am an Assistant Professor in Legal Technologies at Leiden University, working at the intersection of AI, law, and society. With a technical background and eight years of experience working within the legal domain, I focus on the development, deployment, and critical evaluation of algorithmic systems used in legal and other high-stakes contexts. I take a systems-level perspective on technology, focusing on how AI tools shape - and are shaped by - the institutions and contexts in which they are used. I specialise in machine learning applications and examine their potential but also the risks and constraints embedded in their design and use.

More broadly, I work on responsible AI, risk assessment, and the ethics of automation. I collaborate with courts, researchers, and policy institutions to help ensure that the systems we build are not only technically sound but also aligned with broader societal values.

Iâ€™m always open to opportunities where I can apply this perspective to real-world challenges, whether in research, policy, or industry. &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <a style="color: blue" href="./CV/Masha_Medvedeva_CV_2025.pdf" target="_new">View CV</a>
