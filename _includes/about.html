                <p style="font-size: 20px" class="left-three"> I am currently a cross-disciplinary PhD candidate at the University of Groningen. 
                My work lies within automatic detection of linguistic patterns within legal data, with particular focus on predicting court decisions.
                In the past much of my work concerned judgements of the European Court of Human Rights as well as Dutch case law.
                My educational background is in computational linguistics and natural language processing, 
                and I specialise in using machine learning for automating processes within the legal domain.
                My professional interests include but are not limited to improving accessibility to 
                justice through automation, legal analytics, auditing predictive justice algorithms, and related areas. &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <a style="color: blue" href="./img/MashaMedvedeva_ShortCV_02-22.pdf" target="_new">Short CV</a> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <a style="color: blue" href="./img/Masha_Medvedeva_CV_01-22.pdf" target="_new">Full CV</a>
